# MNIST_NN
Neural Network for MNIST

### Link for Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data
### The Neural Network is built from scratch using Numpy, data loading is done using Pandas.
## Performance: 92% accuracy
## Some details
NN will have a simple two-layer architecture. Input layer  a<sup>[0]</sup> will have 784 units corresponding to the 784 pixels in each 28x28 input image. A hidden layer  a<sup>[1]</sup> will have 10 units with ReLU activation, and finally our output layer a<sup>[2]</sup> will have 10 units corresponding to the ten digit classes with softmax activation.
